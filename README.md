Get better insights in the patterns of your users with Laravel tracer, a package that allows you to easily trace user interactions in your Laravel application.

This can be used for a variety of use cases, such as:
- Analytics: Get insights in how users interact with your application, which routes are most popular, etc.
- Heuristics: Optimise the routes your users are actually using, for example by caching the most popular routes.
- Debugging: Get insights in how users are interacting with your application, which can help you identify issues and bugs.

This package doesn't use any external services, all traces are stored in your own database, so you have full control over the data and can easily query it to get the insights you need.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require nietthijmen/laravel-tracer
php artisan laravel-tracer:install
```


This is optional but recommended, but the traces are [prunable](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/eloquent#pruning-models_, so you can set up a schedule to prune old traces, for example:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schedule;

Schedule::command('model:prune', [
    '--model' => [
        \Nietthijmen\LaravelTracer\Models\UserTrace::class
    ],
])->daily();
````


## Usage
The package has 2 middleware, aliased as: traceUser & qualify
The qualify middleware allows you to "overwrite" the route name used for tracing, this is useful for when multiple routes can be grouped together, for example: all routes related to a specific resource.

```php
Route::middleware(['auth', 'traceUser', 'qualify:resource'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/resource', [ResourceController::class, 'index'])->name('resource.index');
    Route::get('/resource/{id}', [ResourceController::class, 'show'])->name('resource.show');
});
```

You can then use the `UserTrace` model to query the traces, for example:

```php
use NietThijmen\LaravelTracer\Models\UserTrace;
$traces = UserTrace::where('qualified_route', 'resource')->get();
```

There's also some configs for the package which get auto-published when you run the install command, you can find them in `config/tracer.php`
These configs allow you to set what gets traced (user agent, ip address, etc.) and also allow you to set a custom model for the traces.
